# Population data

This repository contains daily population records based on a study conducted by the MITMA, that analysed the mobility and distribution of the population in Spain from February 14th 2020 to May 9th 2021. The study is based on a sample of more than 13 million anonymised mobile-phone lines provided by a single mobile operator whose subscribers are evenly distributed.
